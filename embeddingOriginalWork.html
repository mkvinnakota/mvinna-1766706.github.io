           main components such as the cast, plot, and some fun facts</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>The show essentially follows the everyday lives of all the employees at <b>Dunder Mifflin Paper Company</b>
           through a mockumentary structure. Thoughout the show, the workers experience hilarious leadership from their boss, 
           typical fights, huge life changing events, and go through this incredible journey (personally and professionally) 
           with everyone they work with. At they end of the day- they are all <i>family</i>.</p>

        <p>The show's iconic signature is the theme song which many people adore and have recreated into different forms.
           The rolling images shown during the song are clips that John Krasinski, the actor who plays the main character Jim, actually took when
           he was checking out Scranton (the town they would film in).</p>
